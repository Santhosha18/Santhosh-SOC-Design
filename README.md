# Digital VLSI SoC Design and planning Training
Welcome to the OpenLane workshop! In this workshop, we'll explore the complete process of designing an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) using the OpenLane ASIC flow. We'll start with a Register Transfer Level (RTL) design and proceed through each stage of the flow, ultimately generating a Graphical Data System (GDS) file. The workshop covers all essential steps involved in this process.
