# Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning Training

During the OpenLane workshop, I gained hands-on experience in designing an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) using the OpenLane ASIC flow. Starting with a Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, I went through each stage of the flow, learning how to generate a Graphical Data System (GDS) file. The workshop provided me with a deep understanding of the complete ASIC design process and all the essential steps involved.

# Day 1
The RTL to GDSII flow is a crucial process in VLSI design that transforms an RTL description of a digital circuit into a physical layout suitable for fabrication. This flow involves several stages, including RTL synthesis, floor planning, placement, and routing, ultimately producing the GDSII file format, which encapsulates the layout data. This detailed process ensures that the final IC layout accurately represents the intended functionality while adhering to fabrication standards.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fc58e55-ec3e-47fd-9d24-7cf6ea6174d6)
- **Core**

  The core is the central region of the chip where the essential logic circuits are located. It includes all the combinational circuits, as well as soft and hard IPs, and the interconnecting nets. This area is crucial as it contains the main functional elements that drive the chip's operations.

- **Die**

  The die is the section of the chip that encompasses the core and the IO pads. Multiple dies are patterned across a silicon wafer to maximize production efficiency. Each die contains all the necessary components for the chip to function independently once itâ€™s separated from the wafer.

- **IO Pads**

  IO pads serve as the communication bridge between the core and the external environment. These pins allow signals to flow in and out of the chip. Surrounding the IO pads are pad cells, which form rectangular metal patches where external connections are made. The pads include input, output, and power connections, playing a critical role in the chip's interaction with other systems.

- **IPs**

  Foundry IPs are pre-designed blocks that require manual design efforts or human intervention to be defined and created, such as SRAM, ADCs, DACs, and PLLs. These IPs are integral to the chip design, providing ready-made, tested components that can be integrated into the larger design.

- **PDKs**

  PDKs act as the bridge between the foundry and design engineers. They contain a collection of files that model the fabrication process, providing crucial data for design tools used in IC creation. This includes device models, DRC (Design Rule Check), LVS (Layout Versus Schematic), physical extraction, layers, LEF (Library Exchange Format), standard cell libraries, and timing libraries. In this workshop, we use the SkyWater 130nm PDK, specifically the sky130_fd_sc_hd, which is the foundation around which OpenLANE is built.

  # Introduction to RISC-V
  **ISA:** The "Instruction Set Architecture" (ISA) is a fundamental interface between software and hardware. When we write programs in languages like C or Java, these high-level languages need to be translated into a format that a computer can understand. This is where ISA plays a crucial role. It converts the assembly language instructions into binary, the machine's native language. The RISC-V ISA, one of the latest and most advanced architectures, is designed to efficiently perform this translation process.

# Software Applications to Hardware
In everyday scenarios, we usually interact with application software, such as apps, to communicate with hardware. But how does this interaction actually happen? Between the application software and the hardware lies a crucial layer called system software. This layer acts as a mediator, taking the commands from applications and converting them into binary language, which the hardware can understand.

The system software consists of several layers:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3869db1e-957f-4fb8-a612-ec0abd6a15cc)
- **Operating System (OS)**

  Beyond managing essential tasks such as input/output operations, memory management, and low-level system functions, the OS also translates application software into executable code using languages like C, C++, or Java.

- **Compiler**

  The compiler then takes this high-level code from the OS and compiles it into an instruction set, typically resulting in executable files (e.g., .exe). These instructions are specifically designed to match the hardware architecture they will run on.

- **Assembler**

  Finally, the assembler converts these executable files into binary code, which is the machine language that the hardware can understand and execute to carry out the intended operations.

- **RTL Designs**
- **EDA Tools**
- **PDK Data**
  
  ## Key Concepts in Digital ASIC Design

- **What are RTL Designs?**

  RTL (Register-Transfer-Level) design is a critical phase in the VLSI design flow, focused on creating electronic circuits using integrated circuits (ICs). It specifies a digital circuit by describing the flow of digital signals between hardware registers and the logical operations performed on these signals.

- **What are EDA Tools?**

  EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools are software applications used to design and verify the functionality of integrated circuits (ICs). They ensure that the IC meets the required performance and density specifications.

- **What is PDK Data?**

  PDK (Process Design Kit) is a set of files used to model a fabrication process for EDA tools during IC design. This kit includes:

- Process Design Rules:
  - DRC (Design Rule Check)
  - LVS (Layout Versus Schematic)
  - PEX (Parasitic Extraction)

- Device Models

- Digital Standard Cell Libraries

I/O Libraries
# Simplified RTL to GDS Flow

The streamlined RTL to GDSII process starts with an RTL file and, through several key stages, results in a GDSII file ready for fabrication by a foundry. The stages in this process include:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/277c7861-5936-4887-96a9-de1aab8f3925)

    Synthesis: 
    The RTL file is converted into a circuit using components from the Standard Cell Library.
    Standard Cells in the library have a regular layout with the same height but different widths.
    Each cell has various models based on electrical, HDL, Spice, and layout (abstract and detailed) parameters.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d609a73-62eb-448c-8095-0eac4e0a3fd2)

    Floor Planning & Power Planning: 
    Floor Planning: Establishes the placement of components on the chip to optimize area, including the arrangement of I/O pins, ports, and pads.
    Power Planning: Develops the power distribution network (VDD and GND) using power rings, straps, and pads, typically placed on the top metal layers to reduce resistance and delay.
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45afe9d7-53fc-4ba0-9edf-88d0177103a5)

    Placement:
    Components are positioned within the specified regions defined during the floor planning stage.
    Standard Cells needed for the design are arranged within their respective cell boundaries.
    Placement occurs in two phases: Global Placement (where cell overlaps might occur) and Detailed Placement (where cells are precisely positioned according to placement rules).
    
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7776314-ef8f-46f3-b48e-53a4a201de93)

    CTS (Clock Tree Synthesis):
    Clock routing is done prior to signal routing to minimize clock skew, which is the variation in the arrival time of the clock signal at different destinations.
    Symmetrical tree structures like H-tree, I-tree, and X-tree are employed to reduce or eliminate clock skew.
    
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f521c06b-df48-4ae9-b7ac-dc1fc87eeb7d)

    Routing:
    Following clock routing, signal routing is carried out using the available metal layers.
    Routing is categorized into Global Routing (which creates a routing plan based on PDK guidelines) and Detailed Routing (which performs the actual routing according to the plan).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48f066f4-b65a-47e7-b554-57b6027c469d)

    Sign-off:
    After routing is finished, the chip undergoes several verification steps during the sign-off phase:
    Physical Verification Checks:** Includes Design Rule Check (DRC), which verifies adherence to design rules, and Layout vs. Schematic (LVS), which ensures functional correctness against the gate-level netlist.
    Timing Checks:** Static Timing Analysis (STA) is performed to identify and address any timing violations in the design.

# Introduction to OpenLANE Detailed ASIC Design Flow

The image depicts the comprehensive ASIC design flow in OpenLane. The process starts with Design RTL, which is synthesized into an optimized gate-level netlist using Yosys and ABC. This netlist undergoes Static Timing Analysis (STA) to detect timing violations. After STA, Design for Test (DFT) is optionally applied using the

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95ebb1d9-99eb-4395-bb59-2286da076df3)

OpenLane originated as an open-source flow for a genuine open-source tape-out experiment, developed by e-fabless. It is a platform that supports various tools such as Yosys, OpenROAD, Magic, KLlayout, and other open-source tools. OpenLane integrates and abstracts the different stages of silicon implementation. At e-fabless, there is an SoC family known as Strive. Strive represents a collection of open-source SoCs featuring Open PDK, Open RTL, and Open EDA.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d856c790-a03a-4af5-a0c4-f73e452f0bf5)

FAULT (for DFT) includes:

- Scan Insertion
- Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG)
- Test Pattern Compaction
- Fault Coverage
- Fault Simulation

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f5c210e-f341-47b8-96d2-db866b5ebe20)

After DFT, the next phase is Physical Implementation, also known as Automated Place and Route (PnR), using OpenRoad.

OpenRoad (for Physical Implementation) includes:

    Floor/Power Planning
    End Decoupling Capacitors and Tap Cells Insertion
    Placement: Global and Detailed
    Post-Placement Optimization
    Clock Tree Synthesis
    Routing: Global and Detailed

During Place and Route (PnR), Logic Equivalence Checking (LEC) is essential after each design change to verify that the functionality remains consistent despite netlist modifications. Another crucial step in physical implementation is the "Insertion Script for Fake Antenna Diodes."

**Dealing with Antenna Rule Violations:** During fabrication, a metal wire segment can function as an antenna, leading to charge buildup from reactive ion etching. This accumulated charge can potentially harm transistor gates.

**Solutions:**

- **Bridging:** Adding an intermediary layer to connect the metal wire, which necessitates awareness by the router.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fa9fccb-a283-4eff-9d64-587cfa8748e0)

**Solutions:**

- **Add Antenna Diode Cell:** Integrate an antenna diode to dissipate accumulated charges. Antenna diodes are provided by the Standard Cell Library (SCL). For preventive measures, insert a fake antenna diode next to each cell input after placement. Run the Antenna Checker (Magic) on the routed layout. If the checker reports a violation at a cell input pin, replace the fake diode with a real one.

- **Physical Verification:** Conduct final physical verification, which includes:
  - **DRC (Design Rule Checking):** Performed using MAGIC.
  - **LVS (Layout Versus Schematic):** Conducted using MAGIC and Netgen by comparing the extracted SPICE netlist from MAGIC with the Verilog netlist.
  - **STA (Static Timing Analysis):** To identify and address any timing violations in the design.

### Calculate the Flop Ratio (FAL)

1. **Determine the Total Number of Flip-Flops (D):** Count the total number of flip-flops in the design.

2. **Determine the Total Number of Cells:** Count the total number of cells in the design, including all types of cells such as logic gates, flip-flops, and other standard cells.

3. **Apply the Formula:**

  $$
\text{FAL (Flop Ratio)} = \frac{\text{Total Number of Flip-Flops (D)}}{\text{Total Number of Cells}}
$$

4. **Perform the Calculation:** Substitute the values for the total number of flip-flops and the total number of cells into the formula to compute the flop ratio.

5. **Interpret the Result:** The flop ratio represents the proportion of flip-flops relative to the total number of cells. A higher ratio indicates a greater presence of flip-flops in the design.

## Good FloorPlan Vs Bad FloorPlan and Introduction to Library Cells

Chip FloorPlanning Considerations

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aab5f79f-3631-4005-a5af-db3fc51fc9df)

### Utilization Factor and Aspect Ratio

To determine the Utilization Factor and Aspect Ratio, it is essential to define the height and width of both the core and die areas.

**Core Area:**
- The core is the region of the chip designated for placing all the logic cells and components. It contains the actual logic of the chip.

**Die Area:**
- The die area surrounds the core and is used for placing I/O-related components and other peripheral elements.

**Core Area Dimensions:**
- The height and width of the core area are determined by the netlist of the design, which specifies the number and arrangement of components needed to implement the logic.

**Die Area Dimensions:**
- The height and width of the die area depend on the dimensions of the core area, as it must accommodate the core plus additional space for I/O and other components.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e842f0b5-e8fc-47e6-8a74-efb8c62b679d)

For instance, consider a netlist with two logic gates and two flip-flops, each occupying an area of 1 square unit. The netlist consists of 4 elements, so the minimum total area required for the core area would be 4 square units.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60b4abfb-67ee-4ae5-9c27-03e7fcda7bdb)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34eec1f7-f4d7-4d71-afa0-adf446400ddd)

### Utilization Factor:
The Utilization Factor is defined as the ratio of the core area occupied by the netlist to the total core area. For an effective FloorPlan, the Utilization Factor should not be '1'. If the Utilization Factor is '1', it indicates that the core area is fully occupied with no additional space for extra logic, which is indicative of a poor FloorPlan.

`Utilization Factor = (Area occupied by netlist / Total core area)`

**Aspect Ratio**: The Aspect Ratio is defined as the ratio of the height of the core to the width of the core. If the Aspect Ratio is `1`, the core is considered to be square-shaped. For values other than `1`, the core will be rectangular.

`Aspect Ratio = (Height of the core / Width of the core)`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/752d2ccf-43c4-4877-8139-8b9850fc8d23)

In this case, when calculated:

`Utilization factor = (4 squnits) / (4 squnits) = 1`

`Aspect Ratio = (2 units) / (2 units) = 1`  // The core is in a square shape.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e34cc60-5e82-4ffc-bc83-b781dd324062)

In this case, when calculated:

`Utilization factor = (4 squnits) / (8 squnits) = 0.5`

`Aspect Ratio = (2 units) / (4 units) = 0.5`  // The core is in a rectangular shape.

As designers, it is crucial to manage certain switches that influence the floorplan process. For instance, the utilization factor and aspect ratio are key switches that must be carefully reviewed. Designers should verify that these settings align with the project's requirements before initiating the floorplan. The image below highlights various switches used in the floorplan stage.

## Placement in VLSI Design
**The Importance of Placement in VLSI Design**

Placement is a key process in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design, where the physical locations of standard cells or logic elements within a chip are determined. The process is typically divided into two stages:

**Global Placement:**

- General locations are assigned to movable objects (cells).
- Overlaps between placed objects are allowed during this phase.
- The primary objective is to achieve a preliminary layout that meets area requirements.

**Detailed Placement:**

- Refines the positions of objects set during global placement.
- Ensures non-overlapping and proper alignment of cells on legal sites.
- The precision of detailed placement is crucial for the success of the subsequent routing stages.

# Characterizing an Inverter with Sky130 Model Files

## Simulating a CMOS Inverter with ngspice

This guide outlines the steps to create a CMOS inverter netlist, conduct DC and transient analyses using ngspice, and analyze important static and dynamic properties.

## Key Static Characteristics

1. **Switching Threshold (Vth):**
   - The specific voltage where the inverter output switches from logic high (1) to logic low (0).

2. **Input Low Voltage (Vil):**
   - The highest voltage that is still interpreted as a logic 0 by the inverter.

3. **Input High Voltage (Vih):**
   - The lowest voltage that is interpreted as a logic 1 by the inverter.

4. **Output Low Voltage (Vol):**
   - The voltage level when the inverter output changes from high to low.

5. **Output High Voltage (Voh):**
   - The voltage level when the inverter output changes from low to high.

6. **Noise Margins:**
   - Defined by the voltage ranges between Vil and Vol (low noise margin) and between Vih and Voh (high noise margin), representing the inverterâ€™s tolerance to noise.

## Dynamic Characteristics

1. **Propagation Delays:**
   - The duration required for the output to respond to a change in the input signal.

2. **Rise Time (tr):**
   - The duration it takes for the output to rise from Vol to Voh.

3. **Fall Time (tf):**
   - The duration it takes for the output to fall from Voh to Vol.

# Design a Library Cell using Magic Layout and Characterize it with ngspice

## Creating a Standard Cell Layout

**Designing the Inverter Layout:**

1. **Create the Layout:**
   - Use a layout tool (e.g., MAGIC) to design the inverter layout.
   - Adhere to process-specific design rules and guidelines.
   - Position standard cells (transistors, metal layers, etc.) according to the logical schematic.

2. **Extraction Process:**
   - After completing the layout, extract parasitic capacitances and resistances.
   - In the `tkcon` window, run the command `extract all`.
   - This command generates an extracted file containing parasitic information (e.g., capacitances, interconnect resistance).
   - Save the extracted file in the `vsdstdcelldesign` directory.

3. **Create SPICE Netlist:**
   - Use the extracted data to generate a SPICE-compatible netlist (typically in `.sp` or `.cir` format).
   - Include transistor models, capacitances, and resistances.
   - Use this netlist for simulation with tools like ngspice.

## Overview of LEF Files in VLSI Design

**Introduction to LEF Files in VLSI Design**

In VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design, LEF (Library Exchange Format) files are essential for interfacing between layout tools and place-and-route (PnR) tools. 

**Purpose of LEF Files:**

- PnR tools do not need the complete layout information of a block (macro or standard cell). Instead, they require minimal details such as the PR boundary (bounding box) and pin positions.
- LEF files offer an abstract representation of the block, highlighting only the critical information necessary for PnR.
**LEF File Types in VLSI Design**

| **File Type**     | **Description**                                                                                               |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cell LEF**      | Provides an abstract view of the cell, including PR boundary, pin positions, and metal layer information.   |
| **Technology LEF**| Contains details about metal layers, vias, and DRC (Design Rule Checking) technology used by placers and routers. |

# VLSI Routing: Tracks and Routes

In VLSI design, grasping the concepts of tracks and routes is crucial for effective interconnect design. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

## Tracks

Definition:

- Tracks are predefined horizontal and vertical paths on each metal layer.
- They serve as guidelines for routing metal traces within a chip.

Purpose:

- Tracks help maintain uniform spacing and alignment during routing.
- They simplify the routing process by providing fixed paths.

## Routes

Definition:

- Routes are the actual metal traces that carry signals, such as interconnects or wires.
- These traces are placed over the tracks, adhering to specified routing rules.

Functionality:

- Routes connect different components (cells) within the chip.
- They form the wiring network necessary for data flow.

## tracks.info File

- Provides information about horizontal and vertical tracks available on each metal layer.
- Specifies pitch, spacing, and other relevant details necessary for efficient routing.
